# About


### About

As a Senior Linux and Cloud Engineer, I will build tools and automation to eliminate manual operations and craft repeatable processes. This will help maintain a highly available server infrastructure for deploying instances, applying operating system updates, managing configuration changes, and system tuning. I have experience with both application and infrastructure, with experience maintaining a hybrid on-prem and cloud infrastructure. I can assess existing platforms, designing future state, and build a transition plan in order to migrate both applications and infrastructure to a highly resilient environment.
